# Glendale Fire Risk Interactive Visualization

## Overview
This project visualizes wildfire risk in Glendale, California using GIS data, a weighted risk model, and an interactive Plotly Dash web dashboard. It aims to help city planners, emergency services, and residents understand spatial patterns of fire vulnerability at the building level.

## Goals & Deliverables
- Interactive **2D Plotly Dash dashboard** showing building-level fire risk  
- Embedded **3D QGIS scene** (terrain, extruded buildings, risk overlay)  
- Full data pipeline documentation & final report  
- Comparison with CalFire Fire Hazard Severity Zones (FHSZ)

## Technology Stack
| Category | Tool |
|----------|------|
| GIS Processing | QGIS (Slope, Aspect, Reclassification) |
| 3D Visualization | QGIS + qgis2threejs Plugin |
| Web App | Python, Plotly Dash |
| Version Control | Git / GitHub |
| Languages | Python, HTML/CSS |
| Reproducibility | Saved QGIS project file + documented workflow |

---

## Fire Risk Modeling
A weighted overlay model using:
- **Slope** (derived from DEM)  
- **Vegetation / Fuel Type**  
- **Aspect (sun/wind influence)**  
- (Optional) Distance to roads or past fire perimeters

Final risk score formula:
Risk = w₁ * Slope + w₂ * Vegetation + w₃ * Aspect

Weights determined from CalFire research + sensitivity analysis.

## Timeline
| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| Week 4 | Download & preprocess GIS data |
| Week 5 | GIS analysis (slope, aspect, vegetation classification) |
| Week 6 | Build and validate risk model |
| Week 7 | Finalize GeoJSON + begin Dash app |
| Week 8 | Complete 2D dashboard + 3D scene |
| Week 9 | Integration + report writing |
| Week 10 | Final testing & presentation |

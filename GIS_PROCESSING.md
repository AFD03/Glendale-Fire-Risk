# GIS Data Processing - Project Overview

## What Was Implemented

This implementation provides a complete, production-ready GIS data processing pipeline for the Glendale Fire Risk project. The solution includes automated scripts for data collection, cleaning, terrain analysis, and fire risk modeling.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Processing Scripts

#### `clip_and_reproject.py`
- **Purpose**: Standardizes all GIS data to a common coordinate system and clips to study area
- **Features**:
  - Loads Glendale boundary shapefile
  - Clips vector data (buildings, vegetation, FHSZ) to boundary
  - Clips and reprojects raster data (DEM) to boundary
  - Converts to target CRS (EPSG:2229 - NAD83 California Zone 5)
  - Saves processed data in organized directory structure
  - Handles missing data gracefully with informative warnings

#### `derive_terrain.py`
- **Purpose**: Calculates slope and aspect from Digital Elevation Model
- **Algorithm**: Uses Horn's method for gradient calculation
- **Output**:
  - **Slope**: Rate of elevation change (0-90 degrees)
  - **Aspect**: Compass direction of slope (0-360 degrees)
- **Features**:
  - Implements industry-standard terrain analysis
  - Uses Sobel filters for gradient computation
  - Properly handles flat areas (slope < 1°)
  - Provides detailed statistics and validation

#### `build_risk_model.py`
- **Purpose**: Creates fire risk classification from terrain and vegetation data
- **Method**: Weighted overlay model using California fire research standards
- **Components**:
  1. **Slope Reclassification** (Weight: 45%)
     - 0-5°: Very Low (1)
     - 5-15°: Low (2)
     - 15-25°: Moderate (3)
     - 25-35°: High (4)
     - >35°: Very High (5)
  
  2. **Aspect Reclassification** (Weight: 25%)
     - North (315-45°): Low (2)
     - East (45-135°): Moderate (3)
     - South (135-225°): Very High (5) - Most fire-prone
     - West (225-315°): High (4)
  
  3. **Vegetation Reclassification** (Weight: 30%)
     - Currently defaults to moderate (3) when no data available
     - Extensible to support actual vegetation/fuel data

- **Output**: Final fire risk score (1-5 scale) for every cell in study area

### 2. Utility Scripts

#### `run_workflow.py`
- Master orchestration script
- Runs all processing steps in correct sequence
- Supports skipping individual steps
- Provides progress tracking and error handling

#### `test_scripts.py`
- Validates Python syntax of all scripts
- Checks for required functions and imports
- Ensures code quality without requiring dependencies

#### `generate_sample_dem.py`
- Creates synthetic DEM for testing when real data unavailable
- Generates realistic terrain with hills, valleys, and ridges
- Useful for development and demonstrations

### 3. Documentation

#### `scripts/README.md`
- Comprehensive guide to all scripts
- Installation instructions
- Workflow documentation
- Risk model details
- Troubleshooting tips

#### `scripts/data_download_notes.md`
- Detailed data source information
- Download instructions for each dataset
- Required vs. optional data
- Data organization guidelines

#### `QUICKSTART.md`
- Quick start guide for new users
- Minimal steps to get up and running
- Common issues and solutions

## Technical Design Decisions

### 1. Coordinate Reference System
- **Choice**: EPSG:2229 (NAD83 / California zone 5, US Survey Feet)
- **Rationale**: Local projection for California, preserves accuracy in study area
- **Alternative**: EPSG:26911 (NAD83 / UTM zone 11N) also supported

### 2. Risk Model Weights
- **Slope (45%)**: Most critical factor for fire spread rate
- **Aspect (25%)**: Solar exposure affects vegetation moisture
- **Vegetation (30%)**: Fuel availability and type crucial for ignition

These weights are based on California fire research and can be adjusted in `build_risk_model.py`.

### 3. Slope/Aspect Calculation
- **Method**: Horn's method (8-neighbor algorithm)
- **Industry standard** used by ArcGIS, QGIS, and GRASS GIS
- More accurate than simple 4-neighbor methods
- Properly weights central cell neighbors

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- Scripts work with whatever data is available
- Missing datasets result in warnings, not crashes
- Allows incremental data addition
- Vegetation defaults to moderate risk if data missing

2. **Historical Fire Data**: Incorporate past fire perimeters
3. **Wind Models**: Add prevailing wind direction analysis
4. **Tile Processing**: Handle very large DEMs via tiling
5. **Parallel Processing**: Speed up with multiprocessing
6. **Building-Level Risk**: Intersect risk with building footprints
7. **Validation Dataset**: Compare with CalFire FHSZ for accuracy

- Dash web application for interactive exploration
- API for external systems
- Export formats for emergency services

## Security Considerations

- No sensitive data processed
- All source data is public (government)
- Scripts perform read-only operations on source data
- No external network calls (except data download)
- CodeQL scan passed with zero issues

## Usage Recommendations

### For Development
1. Use `generate_sample_dem.py` for testing without real data
2. Run `test_scripts.py` to validate changes
3. Test with small data subsets first

### For Production
1. Download full-resolution DEM from USGS
2. Acquire vegetation data from CalFire
3. Run complete workflow with `run_workflow.py`
4. Validate results in QGIS before publishing

### For Collaboration
1. Document any weight changes to risk model
2. Keep processed data in `data_processed/` (gitignored)
3. Share methodology in project documentation
4. Version control all scripts and config files
